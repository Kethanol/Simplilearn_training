// Waterfall method -> series of concrete steps

// Development -> QA -> validation against the design (robustness, no bugs)
// If the specifications change, we can not change our current implementation

/* SCRUM PRACTICES */

// 1. Product backlog
// Ordered list of tasks to be done in the product
// Living document (the priority of its elements may change over time)
// Tasks are prioritized and ordered accordingly
// The product owner is responsible for it

// 2. Story (user stories)
// Self contained bit of functionality
// Describes a task which will deliver a particular value to a customer
// It has: name, description, estimated value, estimated effort, risks, dependencies, acceptance tests

// 3. Sprint backlog
// A timebox (1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks) specific to scrum
// A list o items (tasks) identified by the scrum team, which must be implemented within the estimated time
// Maintained by the development team

// Tasks or stories are moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog

// 4. Timeboxing
// The process of allocationg an amount of time to a specifing item in the product/sprint backlog
// Prioritizes tasks
// Tracks progress
// Improves predictability
// Improves time management
// Establishes WIP limit

// 5. DoD -- definition of done
// Things that must be verified before marking a story/task as "complete"
// It can apply to: a user story, a sprint, a release, a project

/* SCRUM PRACTICES */

/* PLANNING */

// Layers

// 1. Strategy
// Definition and execution if strategic goals

// 2. Portofolio
// Product offerings

// 3. Product
// Product -> roadmap relation

// 4. Daily
// Plan of action

// 5. Sprint
// User stories that can be completed within a sprint

// 6. Release
// Product backlog items gouped into smaller releases
